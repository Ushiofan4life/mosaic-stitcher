# mosaic-stitcher

Just a bad Python script for putting photos in grids (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animemes/comments/asw2lw/heard_this_sub_likes_effort_but_i_cant_draw_so_i/)). Requires Python 3 or something and some form of the PIL or Pillow library. Run main.py in the same folder as the photos you want to put together. Only works on PNGs (but you could change that).

If you like this software, please leave an issue.
